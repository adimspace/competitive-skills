# Competitive Skills Reference

A comprehensive reference of skills required for international-level competitive mathematics and competitive programming, along with a mapping of each skill to its real-world professional applications.

## Documents

- **Geometry** — Euclidean, circle, projective, inversive, transformations, coordinates
- **Number Theory** — divisibility, modular arithmetic, p-adic valuations, quadratic residues, Diophantine equations

### [Competitive Programming Skills](competitive-programming-skills.md)
Complete topic breakdown for IOI/ICPC-level programming:
- **Data Structures** — segment trees, Fenwick trees, treaps, tries, DSU, HLD, link-cut trees
- **Graph Algorithms** — shortest paths, MST, flows, matching, SCC, 2-SAT
- **Dynamic Programming** — classical, bitmask, tree, digit, SOS, and optimization techniques
- **String Algorithms** — KMP, Aho-Corasick, suffix arrays/automaton, palindromic structures
- **Math for CP** — number theory, combinatorics, linear algebra, FFT/NTT, game theory
- **Computational Geometry** — convex hull, sweep line, Voronoi, Delaunay, polygon operations
- **General Techniques** — binary search, greedy, D&C, bit manipulation, randomized algorithms

### [Professional Applications](professional-applications.md)
For every skill listed above, a detailed mapping to where it is used in modern professional work — or marked as **None (competition-only)** when there is no mainstream industry application. Covers fields such as:
- Cryptography & security
- Machine learning & data science
- Computer graphics & game engines
- Bioinformatics & genomics
- Networking & distributed systems
- Finance & operations research
- Robotics & computer vision
- Compilers & systems programming
